Question to the student: Explain Newton's second law of motion. Provide examples to corroborate your answer

Answer provided by the Student:
The second law of motion says that the more force you apply to an object, the faster it will go. 
It also says that the heavier the object is, the slower it will go. 
For example, if I push a skateboard with a small force, it will move slowly. 
But if I push it with a large force, it will move faster. 
Also, if I put a heavy backpack on the skateboard, it will move slower than without the backpack. 
The second law of motion can be written as F = ma, where F is the force, m is the mass and a is the acceleration.
